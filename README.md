# lab-debugger

This repository contains code examples to use in learning Android Studio's Debugger tool.

If you havenâ€™t already, you should **Fork** and **Clone** this repo in order to complete the tutorial.

## How to start the project

1. Start Android Studio and select **Open an existing Android Studio project**.

2. Navigate to the folder for lab-debugger, select that folder file, and click **OK**.

The Calculator project builds. open the project view if it is not already open.

## How to use the Debugger

In this task you'll get an introduction to the debugger in Android Studio, and learn how to run your app in debug mode.

1. Start and Run your app in debug mode: **Run > Debug app** or click the **Debug icon** in the toolbar.

2. Open the MainActivity.java file and set a breakpoint by clicking in the left gutter of the editor window at the line. A red dot appears at that line, indicating a breakpoint.

3. In the Calculator app on a device, enter a number and click one of the buttons. The execution of your app stops wen it reaches the breakpoint you set, and the debugger shows the current state of your app at that breakpoint.

4. Resume your app's execution with **Run > Resume Program** or click the **Resume** icon on the left side of the debugger window.

## What to do

The app contains 4 errors that you will need to find and fix using the Debugger.

When you are done finding and fixing the errors, commit your changes and push them back up to your forked repository (the `origin`) using the command:

```
git push origin
````
